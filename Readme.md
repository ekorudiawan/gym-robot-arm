# OpenAI Gym 2D Robot Arm Environment

**Description**

This is a OpenAI gym environment for two links robot arm in 2D based on PyGame.

![Robot Arm Environment](./images/robot-arm.gif "Robot Arm Environment")

The robot consist of two links that each links has 100 pixels length, and the goal is reaching red point that generated randomly every episode. 

**RobotArm-V0**

Observation spaces (Continuous):

* target position in x direction (in pixels)
* target position in y direction (in pixels)
* current joint 1 position (in radians)
* current joint 2 position (in radians)

Action Spaces (Discrete):

* 0: Hold current joint angle value
* 1: Increment joint 1
* 2: Decrement joint 1
* 3: Increment joint 2
* 4: Decrement joint 2
* 5: Increment joint 1 and joint 2
* 6: Decrement joint 1 and joint 2

By default, increment or decrement rate for both of joints are 0.01 radians. 

Reward Function:

* Robot will get penalty -1 if current distance between tip and target position is greater equal than previous distance
* Robot will get reward 1 if cureent distance between tip and target position is > -epsilon and < epsilon, where epsilon = 10 pixels

Terminal Condition:

* Current reward is -10 or +10

**RobotArm-V1**

Observation spaces (Continuous):

* target position in x direction (in pixels)
* target position in y direction (in pixels)
* current joint 1 position (in radians)
* current joint 2 position (in radians)

Action Spaces (Continuous):

* 0: joint 1 value (in range -1 to 1)
* 1: joint 2 value (in range -1 to 1)

value will be scaled into minimum and maximum of joint angle

Reward Function:

* reward = -distance_error / 100

Terminal Condition:

* if target position is > -epsilon and < epsilon, where epsilon = 5 pixels

**How To Install**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekorudiawan/gym-robot-arm.git
cd gym-robot-arm
pip install -e .
```

**Dependencies**
* OpenAI Gym
* PyGame
* Scipy

**Testing Environment**

```python
import gym 

env = gym.make('gym_robot_arm:robot-arm-v0')

for i_episode in range(20):
    observation = env.reset()
    for t in range(100):
        env.render()
        print(observation)
        action = env.action_space.sample()
        observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
        if done:
            print("Episode finished after {} timesteps".format(t+1))
            break
env.close()

```
